A power BI Analysis on Road Accident

## Introducton
Road accidents pose a significant threat to public safety and result in casualties, property damage, and economic losses. Analyzing road accident data can provide valuable insights for improving road safety measures and reducing accidents. To address this issue, we aim to leverage a comprehensive road accident dataset containing columns such as Accident ID, Accident Date, Month, Year, Day of the Week, Junction Control, Accident Severity, Latitude, Light Conditions, Weather Conditions, and more.

## Problem Statement
The analysis of road accident data is crucial for understanding and mitigating road safety risks. In this Power BI report, we aim to gain insights from a dataset containing various attributes related to road accidents, such as accident date, severity, weather conditions, and more. The goal is to identify patterns and factors contributing to accidents and recommend strategies for reducing their occurrence.

## Tools used
- Power BI

Dataset was downloaded from an open source.

## Task
1. Import and preprocess the road accident dataset in Power BI.
2. Visualize the number of accidents over time (by year, month, and day of the week) to identify trends.
3. Analyze the distribution of accident severity.
4. Investigate the influence of lighting conditions and weather on accidents.
5. Investigate the types of vehicles involved in accidents.
6. Generate actionable insights and recommendations for improving road safety based on the analysis.

#### Expected Outcome:
By the end of this project, we aim to provide a comprehensive analysis of road accidents using Power BI, with insights that can inform road safety policies, enforcement measures, and public awareness campaigns to reduce accidents and save lives.

## Visualization

1. Accident Severity Analysis: Cards showing the total casualties, fatal casualties, serious casualties and slight casualties.
2. Accident Trends Over Time: Line chart showing the trend of accidents over the years.
Insight: Identify if there is a significant change in the number of accidents over time. This can help in long-term safety planning.
3. Weather Conditions vs. Accident Severity: Bar chart showing the relationship between weather conditions and accident severity.
Insight: Identify if specific weather conditions are associated with more severe accidents, leading to weather-related safety recommendations.
4. Lighting and Weather Conditions: Analyzed casualties by lighting and weather conditions. This can help people to be cautious when driving during certain time and weather conditions.
5. Casualties by area and road type: Pie chart and tree map showing casualties by area and road type.

## Recommendation
1. Weather-Based Warnings: Implement real-time weather-based warnings to drivers during adverse conditions, such as heavy rain, snow, or Dry times.
2. Enhanced Urban Safety: Focus on urban areas with high accident rates by improving road design, signage, and traffic management.
3. Drivers should be cautious when driving in the daylight has it has high recorded amount of casualties.
4. Education and Awareness: Launch public awareness campaigns to educate drivers about safe practices during peak accident periods, emphasizing the importance of defensive driving.
5. Continuous Monitoring: Establish a system for continuous monitoring and evaluation of road safety measures to adapt and improve strategies over time.

## Conclusion
In conclusion, the analysis of road accident data has provided valuable insights into the patterns and factors associated with accidents. By identifying risk factors, targeting interventions, and emphasizing severity reduction, we can work towards reducing road accidents and improving overall road safety. The recommendations provided serve as a roadmap for policymakers and authorities to take proactive measures to mitigate the impact of accidents on public safety and well-being.
